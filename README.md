## MetaOS ##
MetaOS is an distributed service-oriented ecosystem, which grounded on a simple premise: your computer should be a powerful, integrated tool that serves you, not the other way around. We combine the flexibility of Linux with a deep, thoughtful integration of services to create an environment that is secure, controllable, and inspiring.
Instead of hiding powerful tools, we provide a unified interface to control them. Instead of isolated applications, we build a cohesive system. MetaOS is designed to be your digital command center and your creative workshop.

The development and philosophy of MetaOS are structured around three distinct clusters. Each represents a fundamental pillar of the user experience and on of the 3 principles
- 🛡️ Security sector 
- 📲 Control sector
- ⚙️ Utility Sector
---

## 🛡️ Security Sector ##

#### Privacy by default #### 
> This principle is achieved by integrating existing components into the system, such as Matrix for secure messaging, and creating new ones by combining existing ones, such as VPNs, which will work autonomously in certain scenarios.

| Component | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in VPN** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | System-level integration with scenario-based automation. |
| **Matrix Integration** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | Native integration for the decentralized, encrypted Matrix protocol. |
| **Face ID** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | Secure login using webcam-based facial recognition. |
| **Security & IoT Hub**| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | Integration with smart security systems like Ajax, Bosch, etc. |

## 📱 Control Sector ##

#### Extensibility by design ####

> A principle that speaks for itself. Adding new features — from local services to remote controllers — is simple and does not compromise system stability.

| Component | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
|**Metahub** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)|The central Qt-based desktop application for managing and interacting with all system components. 
|**MetaOS Controller**| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow) | Point of remote management of all other daemons.
|**Android/iOS Client**| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow) | A native mobile client for remote management, notifications, and deep integration with your phone.
| **AI System Assistant** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | A personal assistant to simplify system interaction, manage tasks, and enhance security. 

## ⚙️ Utility Sector ##

#### Compatibility without compromise ####

> This addresses the problem of using software that is not ported to Linux, and this principle is achieved by simplifying the use of existing tools that help solve problems with the inability to work in certain programmes.

| Component | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
|**CI/CD Module** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)| A system service for monitoring your development pipelines directly from the OS. 
|**D-Bus Integration** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)| Adherence to modern Linux standards for robust and efficient Inter-Process Communication.
|**GPU Passthrough** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-planned-lightgrey) | Simplify your gaming and working experience.
