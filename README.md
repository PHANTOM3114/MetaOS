# MetaOS
**MetaOS** is an distributed service-oriented ecosystem, which grounded on a simple premise: your computer should be a powerful, integrated tool that serves you, not the other way around. We combine the flexibility of Linux with a deep, thoughtful integration of services to create an environment that is secure, controllable, and inspiring.
Instead of hiding powerful tools, we provide a unified interface to control them. Instead of isolated applications, we build a cohesive system. MetaOS is designed to be your digital command center and your creative workshop.

## 🧠 Philosophy

The development and philosophy of MetaOS are structured around three distinct principles, embodied by their respective sectors:

* 🛡️ **Security Sector - Privacy by Default**: We believe privacy is a non-negotiable right. This is achieved by integrating natively secure components like the Matrix protocol and building autonomous, scenario-based security tools like the built-in VPN. Your data and communications should be yours alone.

* 📲 **Control Sector - Extensibility by Design**: Your system should adapt to you, not the other way around. Adding new features — from local services to remote controllers — is designed to be simple and not compromise system stability. You are the architect of your digital environment.

* ⚙️ **Utility Sector - Compatibility without Compromise**: We address the challenge of using software not natively ported to Linux. This principle is achieved by simplifying the use of existing tools, such as GPU Passthrough, to ensure you can work and play without limitations.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

MetaOS is not a monolithic application but an ecosystem of interconnected, independent services that communicate via standardized protocols like **gRPC** and **D-Bus**.

The system is built on the interaction of two key component types:

* **Modules:** Separate, independent applications that perform specific functions (e.g., `cicd_module`, `vpn_module`). They are the "organs" of the system.
* **MetaDaemon:** The **"remote cycle"** of the ecosystem. It acts as the central nervous system, with its controllers managing modules through standard D-Bus calls for remote operations.
* **Metahub:** The **"local cycle"** of the ecosystem. This central Qt-based desktop application is your command center for on-site management, providing a unified graphical interface to all system components.

This service-oriented design ensures robustness, flexibility, and makes the entire ecosystem highly extensible.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Architectural Requirement:** The MetaOS ecosystem is designed and built exclusively for the **Linux** operating system. Therefore, all development must ultimately take place within a Linux environment to ensure full compatibility.

### Environment Setup

The project's development environment is currently undergoing refinement to ensure a stable and straightforward setup process. To avoid providing potentially outdated instructions, we ask that you refer to the official documentation for setting up the core dependencies.

1. **Install System Dependencies:** 

Debian/Ubuntu:
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git clang lld pkg-config libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev nlohmann-json3-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-tools-dev libsdbus-c++-dev libgrpc++-dev libprotobuf-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev protobuf-compiler-grpc
  
If you are on the other distro, package names may be different

3.  **For non-Linux platforms (macOS / Windows):** The officially supported method is to use an isolated development container.
    
    (Placeholder: A detailed, validated guide for setting up and using the recommended development environment will be added here once the configuration is finalized).

### Building and Running

Build all tagrets:

    cmake -B build && cmake --build build

> More detailed build and run instructions for each individual component can be found in their respective documentation files within the `/docs` directory.
