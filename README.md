## MetaOS ##

MetaOS is an operating system, which grounded on ecosystem built on a simple premise: your computer should be a powerful, integrated tool that serves you, not the other way around. We combine the flexibility of Linux with a deep, thoughtful integration of services to create an environment that is secure, controllable, and inspiring.
Instead of hiding powerful tools, we provide a unified interface to control them. Instead of isolated applications, we build a cohesive system. MetaOS is designed to be your digital command center and your creative workshop.
The development and philosophy of MetaOS are structured around four distinct clusters. Each represents a fundamental pillar of the user experience.
- üõ°Ô∏è Security sector 
- üì≤ Control sector
- ‚öôÔ∏è Utility Sector
